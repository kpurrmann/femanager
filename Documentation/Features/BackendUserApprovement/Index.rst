Backend User Approvment
=======================

Since Version 3.0

If you activate UserApprovements by Admins, you can receive approvement e-mails and acitvate them by clicking a link in e-mail.

Now you can use also a backend module and approve them via backend.

How to:

* Login in to the backend
* Open the Fontend User Module
* Change to the tab "Approve Users". This tab is only visible, if there are open approvements.
